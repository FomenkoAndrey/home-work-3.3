    OF ENGINEERING INDUSTRY BUSINESS ENTITIES</h1>

  <h2>Kuzenko T. B., Sablina N. V., Zlenko N. V.</h2>

  <p class="different-first-letter"><b>Abstract.</b> The article provides an analytical assessment of the crisis
    condition of
    engineering industry business entities. As the assessment methods were used statistical method,
    establish causation, integral indicator for the models of bankruptcy probability, integrated indicator
    of crisis, cluster analysis by the level of adaptive capacity and discriminant analysis. As a result of
    the application of these methods the analytical conclusions were done. Established that the
    engineering industry is indeed in crisis due to a number of problems solution of which must occur at
    the national level. However, given the uncertainty about the length of the implementation and the
    effectiveness of government measures to overcome the industry crisis, business entities are offered
    to develop measures to adapt to the crisis conditions of operation.

  <p class="different-first-letter"><b>Introduction.</b> Engineering industry is one of the leading industries in
    Ukraine. It has a
    decisive influence on the pace of scientific and technological progress, productivity and the
    economy of the country as a whole. However, in recent years, engineering industry is characterized
    by a number of problems that lead to a decrease in the volume of sales, losses, or even bankruptcy
    of business entities in the industry. The scale of these and other problems allows us to assume that
    today there is not only the crisis of individual engineering units, but also the crisis of the industry as
    a whole. In this case, these problems need to be solved mostly at the state level, since a separate
    business unit cannot cope with the industrial crisis. However, taking into account the uncertainty
    concerning the duration of implementation and the effectiveness of state measures of overcoming
    the industrial crisis, the topical question is, in our opinion, if it is possible to stabilize the situation
    at
    the micro level. According to the author, although a separate business unit cannot overcome the
    crisis on its own, however, it is able to try to adapt to adverse environmental conditions through the
    introduction of certain adaptation measures. The effectiveness of such measures depends, among
    other things, on a timely and reliable analytical assessment of the crisis situation of business
    entities.</p>
  <p class="different-first-letter"><b>Literature review and the problem statement.</b> A lot of researchers took
    an analytical
    assessment of the crisis situation of business entities, namely: Blank I.A. [1], Arefieva O. V. [2],
    Kuzenko T. B. [3], Nieskorodieva I.I. [4], Koshkin V.I. [5], Utkin E. A. [6], Hriaznova A. H. [7],
    Meier K. i Sten D. [8], Akoff R. L. [9], Turylo A. M. i Bohachevska K. V. [10], Kulikov P. M.
    [11], Mazaraki A. A. i Kasianova A. O. [12] and others. However, in the works of scientists
    insufficient attention is paid to the peculiarities of such an assessment in a global or industrial crisis.
    As we have already noted, a separate business unit is not able to overcome the industrial crisis on its
    own, and therefore there is a need to develop measures for adaptation to crisis conditions of
    functioning. Necessary basis for the development of such measures is the assessment of the
    adaptive capacity of business entities, with which we propose to complement the general analytical
    assessment of the crisis situation of business entities in the engineering industry.</p>
  <p class="different-first-letter"><b>The purpose of the study</b> is to conduct an analytical assessment of the
    crisis situation of
    business entities in the engineering industry. The methods of evaluation are the following: the
    statistical method, the method for establishing causal relationships, the integral index on the models
    of bankruptcy probabilities, the integral indicator of the crisis state, the cluster analysis by the level
    of adaptive potential and the discriminant analysis.</p>
  <p class="different-first-letter"><b>Research results.</b> According to the author, the first step in analytical
    assessment of the
    crisis situation of business entities in the engineering industry should be the determination of the
    main problems of engineering and their origin, as well as the investigation of the consequences of
    such problems, one of which is, among other things, falling volumes of sold products. In addition,
    the result of this study will make it possible to finally state whether the current situation is a crisis
    of the industry as a whole (the crisis on the mesolevel), or the concept of crisis can be used only
    concerning individual economic units, that is, the crisis is present only at the micro level.</p>
  <p class="different-first-letter">The list of main problems in the field of engineering is presented in the
    Concept of the
    National Target Economic Program for the Development of Industry for the period up to 2020. The
    document identifies these problems as problems of industrial development in general, but
    considering that engineering is one of the priority sectors of the national economy, all these
    problems are related to it directly. The range of the above problems is presented in Fig. 1, where we
    also identified the linkages between the problems and the reasons that, in our opinion, caused them.</p>

    <p>Are the proposed methods suitable for other branches or just for the engineering industry?</p>

    <p>Liked the idea conserning adaptation, but it was hard to follow the process of indicator selection.</p>
